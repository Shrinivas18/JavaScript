The ... (three dots) syntax in JavaScript, when used in certain contexts, is known as the
rest parameter or rest operator. It is used to collect multiple elements into a single Array
or Object, which is the opposite of the spread operator.

// Usage of the Rest Parameter
The primary use cases for the rest parameter are in function definitions and destructuring assignments.

1. In Function Parameters
   The rest parameter allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments and bundles them into a single, real array. This array can then utilize all standard array methods
   (like map(), filter(), pop(), etc.).

- Syntax: It must be the last parameter in a function definition, prefixed by three dots. A function can only have one rest parameter.

- With other parameters: It only collects the remaining arguments after the named ones have been assigned.

2. In Array Destructuring
   When destructuring an array, the rest syntax can be used to gather the remaining elements that weren't explicitly assigned to other variables.

3. In Object Destructuring
   Similarly, the rest syntax works with object destructuring to collect the remaining properties into a new object.

## Key Points

A. Syntax: Both rest and spread use the same ... syntax, but their function is determined by their position in the code.

B. Rest (packs): Gathers multiple items/arguments into a single array or object (left-hand side
of an assignment or in a function parameter list).

C. Spread (expands): Expands an iterable (array, object, string) into individual elements (right-hand side of an assignment or in a function call).
